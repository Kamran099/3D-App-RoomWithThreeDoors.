Write and test 3D apps in Desktop Java IDE before building them in C3dapp Studio for Website use.

By following this tutorial I was guided through the process of how to build a 3D app showing a room with three doors. Two people enter the room through the entrance door before splitting up and exiting through the two exit doors separately.

C3dapp Studio is a cloud environment in which you can use Java programming language to write 3D apps for websites and run them in web browsers. You can do the complete 3D app development work in browser without needing to install Java or an IDE on your computer.

However, if you prefer to develop and test 3D apps in Desktop mode before transferring them for website use, you can use the C3dappSDK in a Java IDE on your computer to help writing the Java codes, building and testing the 3D apps locally in your desktop environment before turning the 3D apps into browser mode through C3dapp Studio for website use.
